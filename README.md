# Go clean architecture

This repository is an implementation of
the [Developing a RESTful API with Go and Gin](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin) tutorial to learn Go
language.

The purpose of this project was to learn Go and to experiment:

* Clean architecture in Go.
* The [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) package for the tests.
* [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in Go.
* The [Gin Web Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) (REST API).
* Dependency Injection.

⚠️ Remark: as it was my first project in Go, Go best practices might be not respected.
